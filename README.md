Ancient tool that could enumerate users on Coinbase. No idea if that vulnerability still works. Essentially, if you attempted to register an account that already existed, it would redirect you to the login page. Was useful a long time ago for skid swapping on pentests with the thousands of companies deploying ICOs. 

It would also defeat Google's recaptcha service via 2captcha so you could enumerate thousands of accounts very quickly for credential stuffing attacks through BlueStacks, residential proxies, and stolen cookies to bypass security controls on Coinbase. The API keys in this code no longer work.
